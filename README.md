dms_to_dd.py is a python script/modual to convert an angle in ddd.mmss(degrees minutes and seconds) format primarily used in land surveying to decimal degrees to make it more application friendly. 

vertdist.py is a python script to compute vertical distance from a user provided zenith angle(za) and a slope distance(sd)
(the distance along the zenith angle). User input format is za, sd

future plan is to add the total station (measurment instrument) height above the first point and the prizm pole (target) hieght above the second point
