dms_to_dd.py is a python script/modual to convert an angle in ddd.mmss format primarily used in land surveying to decimal degrees
to make it more application friendly. 

vertdist.py is a python script to compute vertical distance from a user provided zenith angle(za) and a slope distance(sd)
(the distance along the zenith angle). User input format is za, sd

future plan is to add the measurment instrument height above the first point and the target hieght above the second point
